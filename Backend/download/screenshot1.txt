I'D NEVER GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT TO HOW I WOULD
die— chough I'd had reason enough in the last few
months — but even if I had, I would not have imagined it
like this.
I stared without breathing across the long room, into
the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked pleasantly back
at me.
Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone
else, sorneone I loved. Noble, even. That ought to count
for something.
I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be
facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't bring
myselfto regret the decision. When life offers you a dream
so far beyond any of your expectations, it's not reasonable
to grieve when it comes to an end.
The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered
forward to kill me.
